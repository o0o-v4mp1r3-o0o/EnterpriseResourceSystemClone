An ERP system built with a PostgreSQL database. It is inspired by SAP, where it gives you the ability to login and edit tables that you created in the form of orders or bids on products for your company. Uses SQL commands to organize tables at the click of the user's button. 

It also gives the user the ability to edit their own orders, delete, and add new ones. They have their own personalized Dashboard where all important items are shown.
